## Hollandaise Sauce

- 1/4 pound of sweet butter
- 3 egg yolks
- 2 teaspoons of lemon juice
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt

Use a double boiler for this sauce. Heat water in the lower part of the boiler and put the butter in the top section over the hot water. Beat the egg yolks lightly with the lemon juice and salt. Add them to the melted butter, beating constantly. Do not let the water boil. Continue beating and cooking over hot water until the sauce is thickened and hot. Serve at once.

Note: If the sauce starts to curdle while cooking, add a spoonful or so of hot water and beat it in.

VARIATIONS

- With mustard: Add 1 or 2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard or 1/4 teaspoon of dry mustard.
- With tarragon: Add 1/2 teaspoon of tarragon or substitute tarragon vinegar for the lemon juice.
- Quick Hollandaise: Place 3 egg yolks in a blender or food processor with 2 teaspoons of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a few grains of cayenne pepper. Turn the blender or processor on for 2 or 3 seconds to blend the eggs and seasonings quickly. Melt 1/4 pound of sweet butter in a saucepan and heat almost to the boiling point. Turn on the blender (on high) or processor and pour the hot butter steadily into the egg mixture until the butter is blended and the sauce thickened.
