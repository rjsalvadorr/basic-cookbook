## Chicken Tikka Masala With Roasted Cauliflower & Red Onion

Indian food is traditionally paired with a cooling yogurt sauce, which here gets a kick from smoked paprika and cumin. You can replace the boneless thighs with drumsticks or bone-in breasts, although the cooking time will increase.

- 1 cup (8 oz/250 g) plain whole-milk Greek yogurt
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1 1/2-inch (4-cm) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon each paprika and cayenne pepper
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 6 skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 21/2 lb/1.25 kg total)
- 1 head cauliflower, cut into small florets
- 1 large red onion, cut into 1/2-inch (12-mm) pieces
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil

FOR THE PAPRIKA-YOGURT SAUCE

- 1 1/4 cups (10 oz/315 g) plain whole-milk Greek yogurt
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

SERVES 4–6

1. In a large nonaluminum bowl, whisk together the yogurt, lemon juice, ginger, garlic, tomato paste, garam masala, cumin, paprika, cayenne, and 1 teaspoon salt. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 6 hours.
1. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil.
1. Remove the chicken from the marinade and transfer to the prepared pan, spreading the pieces out on the pan in a single layer. Roast for 10 minutes.
1. In another large bowl, toss together the cauliflower, onion, and oil. Place in a single layer around the chicken. Season the vegetables generously with salt and black pepper. Roast until the cauliflower begins to brown, about 20 minutes, then stir the vegetables. Continue roasting until the chicken is opaque throughout and the cauliflower is fork-tender, 10–15 minutes longer.
1. Meanwhile, prepare the paprika-yogurt sauce: In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, garlic, oil, smoked paprika, and cumin, and season with salt. Dollop the sauce on top of the chicken and serve right away with the vegetables alongside.
