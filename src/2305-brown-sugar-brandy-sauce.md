## Brown Sugar Brandy Sauce

- 1/2 cup of brown sugar
- 1/2 cup of water
- Pinch of salt
- 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch
- Cognac or dark rum (about 2 ounces)

Put the brown sugar and water in a saucepan with the salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 3 or 4 minutes. Blend a scant half tablespoon of cornstarch in two tablespoons of water and add to the brown sugar mix, stirring it in and cooking until the mixture thickens. Remove from the stove and add Cognac or dark rum to taste.
