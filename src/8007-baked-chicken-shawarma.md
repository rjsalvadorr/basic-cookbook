## Chicken Shawarma With Onions, Peppers & Tahini Sauce

Warmly spiced chicken and vegetables make a wonderful Middle Eastern dinner, especially when served with homemade tahini sauce. If you are short on time, replace the tahini sauce with store-bought hummus.

- 6 tablespoons (90 ml) olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 3/4 teaspoon paprika
- Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1 1/2 lb (750 g) skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch (12-mm) slices
- 1 red and 1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and sliced into 1/2-inch-thick (12-mm) slices
- 1 red onion, halved and sliced into 1/2-inch-thick (12-mm) slices
- 6 pieces lavash or pita bread, warmed (optional)

FOR THE TAHINI SAUCE

- 1 clove garlic
- 1/2 cup (5 oz/155 g) tahini
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- Kosher salt
- 1/2 cup (120 ml) warm water

SERVES 4–6

1. In a large bowl, whisk together 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of the oil, the lemon juice, garlic, cumin, turmeric, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil.
1. Remove the chicken from the marinade and place in a single layer on one end of the prepared pan. In another bowl, toss together the bell peppers, onion, and the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Place the vegetables in a single layer on the other end of the pan. Season the chicken and vegetables with salt and pepper. Roast, stirring once, until the chicken is opaque throughout and the vegetables are fork-tender, 25–30 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, prepare the tahini sauce: In a food processor or blender, combine the garlic, tahini, lemon juice, cumin, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and purée until well blended. Add the warm water and purée until smooth. Adjust the seasoning with salt.
1. Fill the lavash, if using, with the chicken and vegetables, drizzle with the tahini sauce, and serve.
