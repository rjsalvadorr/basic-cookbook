## Curry Sauce

- 5 tablespoons of butter
- 1 large onion
- 1 apple
- 2 stalks of celery
- Salt
- Curry powder
- 1 to 1 1/2 cups of broth, stock or tomato juice
- 2 teaspoons of chutney

Melt the butter. Peel and chop the onion. Core the apple and chop with the skin left on. Chop the celery. Sauté these in the butter gently until just transparent. Do not let them brown. Sprinkle with curry powder (up to 3 teaspoons for a mild curry, 1 tablespoon or more for hot curry). Season to taste with salt, and let this cook down into the vegetables and apple for 3 or 4 minutes. Add broth, stock or tomato juice to taste. About 1 to 1 1/2 cups will serve two persons amply. You may thicken the sauce with a few tablespoons of tomato paste, or, if you prefer, add pea-sized balls of butter and flour mixed together (see instructions under Beurre Manié, page 348). Just before serving, add the chutney.

This sauce can be used with any leftover meat. Cut the meat into dice, and add it to the sauce to heat. It can also be used with canned tuna fish, with crabmeat or lobster meat, or with any leftover fish.
