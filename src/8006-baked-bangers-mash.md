## Bangers & Smashed Potatoes With Whole-Grain Dijonnaise

Serve this classic English pub fare for a weeknight meal paired with a simple green salad. Leftover Dijonnaise is terrific spread on sandwiches the next day.

- 1 1/2 lb (750 g) small Yukon gold potatoes
- 2 red onions, quartered
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
- 6 bangers or other beef or pork sausages

FOR THE DIJONNAISE

- 1/2 cup (4 oz/125 g) whole-grain Dijon mustard
- 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

SERVES 4–6

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil.
1. In a large bowl, toss together the potatoes, onions, and oil, and season generously with salt and pepper. Place the potatoes and onions in a single layer all over the prepared pan and roast for 10 minutes.
1. Nestle the sausages into the vegetables and roast for 15 minutes, then flip the sausages and stir the potatoes and onions. Continue roasting until the sausages are cooked through, the potatoes are fork-tender, and the onions are browned on the edges, about 10 minutes longer. Using a potato masher or a large fork, smash each potato so that the skin breaks and the soft center is exposed.
1. To prepare the Dijonnaise, in a small bowl, stir together the mustard, mayonnaise, and lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Serve the sausage, potatoes, and onions with the Dijonnaise alongside.
