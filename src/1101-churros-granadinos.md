## Churros Granadinos

Also known as _Porras_.

**INGREDIENTS**

- 250 grams flour
- 1 tbsp yeast
- 1/2 tbsp or 1 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp oil
- 1/2 tbsp sugar
- 270 mL water

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Boil water in a pot with oil, salt, and sugar
1. Mix the flour and yeast in a separate bowl
1. When the water cools down (but is still warm), mix in the yeast and stir until there's no large lumps and the batter doesn't stick to the pot. A bit of force isn't bad if it feels tougher than expected
1. When the batter is cooled, pour it into a pastry bag or churrera
1. Heat oil in a pan, fry the churros straight from the churrera
1. Fry until golden brown

You can serve these as is, or with sugar. But the best is with coffee or _chocolate_
