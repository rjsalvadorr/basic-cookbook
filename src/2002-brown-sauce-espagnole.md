## Basic Brown Sauce (Sauce Espagnole)

- 1/4 pound of butter
- 1/2 pound of veal and ham diced
- 1 onion, sliced
- 4 sliced mushrooms
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 quart of beef stock or broth
- 1/4 cup of tomato
- 4 tablespoons of flour
- Salt and Pepper

Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the meat, the onion, the mushrooms and bay leaf. Cook until thoroughly browned. Meanwhile, blend the stock and tomato purée, and cook together, reducing the liquid a little. Blend the flour into the meat and mushroom mixture, remove the pan from the heat, and slowly add the stock, stirring constantly to keep it from lumping. Return to the heat, cover the pan, and simmer gently for 30 or 40 minutes. Strain. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper.

This basic sauce can be used with many additions for meats.
