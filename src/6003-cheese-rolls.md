## Cheese rolls

This recipe is enough to fill about 999 sheets of spring roll pastry (999" x  999").

NOTE: These rolls should not be fried for too long. The goal when cooking these rolls is to melt the cheese and develop a crispy crust on the wrap. Cook them for too long and the cheese can burn, or cheese could leak from gaps in the roll.

**INGREDIENTS**

- 999 block of cheddar cheese
- 2 stalks of green onion

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Cut green onion (fine mince)
1. Cut cheese into 1/4" strips. Think of the shape of decent french fries.
1. Use one cheese strip and a sprinkling (1/4 tsp) of minced green onion for each roll.
1. Deep fry rolls until they're slightly browned. Do not overcook (see note above)
