## Slow Cooker Carnitas

Original recipe: budgetbytes.com/slow-cooker-carnitas/

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1 yellow onion
* 4 cloves garlic
* 2 small cinnamon sticks
* 1/2 Tbsp oregano
* 1/2 Tbsp cumin
* 1 tsp salt
* Freshly cracked pepper
* 1/2 tsp chipotle pepper powder
* 1 tsp chili flakes (optional)
* 3 lb (1.36 kg) pork butt roast
* 2 small (or one large) orange

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. In a large bowl, combine the oregano, cumin, salt, pepper, chipotle powder, and chili flakes. Put aside for later.
1. Dice the onion and peel the garlic cloves. Place the onion, garlic, and cinnamon sticks in the bottom of the slow cooker.
1. Cut the pork roast into 2-inch cubes. Place the cubed meat in the bowl with seasoning. Toss the meat in the spices until evenly coated. Place the meat in the slow cooker on top of the onion, garlic, and cinnamon.
1. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the thin layer of orange zest from one of the oranges. Squeeze about 1/2 cup juice from the oranges. Pour the orange juice over the meat in the slow cooker, then sprinkle the pieces of orange zest over top.
1. Place the lid on the slow cooker, turn it on to high, and cook for 5 hours, or until the meat is tender and falls apart.
1. Use tongs to stir and shred the meat, and remove the cinnamon sticks. You can serve as-is, or transfer the meat and some of the liquid to a skillet (preferably non-stick or cast iron). You can also divide the meat and liquid into containers to refrigerate for later
1. Cook the meat over medium flame until browned and crispy on the edges. Avoid stirring the meat too much as it will break down into tiny pieces. Use the crispy meat as a filling for tacos, burritos, nachos, or burrito bowls.
