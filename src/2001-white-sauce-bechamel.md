## Basic White Sauce (Cream Sauce Or Béchamel)

- 2 tablespoons of butter
- 2 tablespoons of flour
- 1 cup of milk
- Salt and pepper

Melt the butter and blend in the flour. Remove the pan from the heat, or place it over hot water (see instructions page 347 under Roux). Slowly add the milk, blending it in until smooth. Return to the heat and cook slowly, stirring constantly, until the sauce is thickened and smooth. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. For a thicker sauce use 3 or 4 tablespoons of flour.

VARIATIONS

- Rich Cream Sauce: This sauce can be made richer by using heavy cream for half of the milk or by reducing the amount of flour by 1/2 tablespoon and adding 1 egg yolk after the sauce has been thickened. Follow directions for thickening with Egg Yolks, page 348.
- With meat or fish: If you are using this sauce with meat or fish, substitute the juices or stock for the meat or fish for part of the milk.
- With vegetables: Cook down the liquid from the vegetable and blend it with heavy cream for the liquid in the sauce.
- Sauce Mornay: Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese and 2 tablespoons of butter.
- Cheese Sauce: Add 1/2 cup of grated sharp cheddar, Gruyère or Emmenthaler and a dash of Tabasco or dry mustard.
- Sauce Soubise: Sauté 1 sliced medium onion in the butter over low heat, covered, until tender but not brown, about 20 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook for a minute or so. Then stir in the milk. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Purée in a blender or food processor. Add seasonings, and just before serving, heat through and beat in 2 tablespoons of butter, one at a time.
- Mustard Sauce: Add 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard and simmer for 2 or 3 minutes.
- Horseradish Sauce: Drain bottled horseradish thoroughly and add it to the sauce to taste. Or use grated fresh horseradish and a dash of wine vinegar or lemon juice.
- Egg Sauce: Add 2 hard-cooked eggs, sliced.
- Caper Sauce: Add 3 tablespoons of capers and a spoonful of the caper juice.
- Dill Sauce: Add 1 tablespoon of fresh, chopped dill or 2 teaspoons of dried dill weed.
- Creamy Curry Sauce: Cook 2 teaspoons (or more, to taste) of curry powder with the butter before adding the flour. Then proceed as for Basic White Sauce.
