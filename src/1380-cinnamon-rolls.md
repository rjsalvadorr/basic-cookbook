**INGREDIENTS**

- 2 3/4 cups (344 g) flour
- 1/4 cup (50 g) sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 1/4 tsp yeast
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1/4 cup water
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter (45 g)
- 1 egg

FILLING

- 3 tbsp (45g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 1 tbsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar or packed light or dark brown sugar

ICING

- 1 cup (120g) confectioners’ sugar
- 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 2–3 tbsp (30-45ml) strong brewed coffee or milk

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Make the dough: Whisk the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast together in a large bowl. Set aside.
1. Combine milk, water, and butter together in a bowl. Heat until the butter is melted and the mixture is warm to touch (about 110°F). Pour into the dry ingredients, add the egg, and stir until it forms a soft dough or use your mixer.
1. On a lightly floured surface using floured hands, knead the dough for 3 minutes. Place in a lightly greased bowl, cover loosely, and let rest for about 10 minutes.
1. Fill the rolls: After 10 minutes, roll the dough out in a 14×8 inch rectangle. Spread the softened butter on top. Mix together the cinnamon and sugar. Sprinkle it all over the dough. Roll up the dough tightly to make a 14 inch log. Cut into 10-12 even rolls and arrange in a lightly greased 9-inch round cake pan or pie dish.
1. Rise: Tightly cover the rolls and allow to rise in a warm, draft-free environment for 60-90 minutes.
1. Bake the rolls: After the rolls have doubled in size, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake for 25-28 minutes until lightly browned. If you notice the tops are getting too brown too quickly, loosely cover the rolls with aluminum foil and continue baking.
1. Make the icing: Whisk the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla extract, and coffee/milk together. Drizzle or spread over warm rolls.
