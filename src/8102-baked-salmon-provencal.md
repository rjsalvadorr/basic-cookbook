## Salmon Provençal With Fingerling Potatoes & Cherry Tomatoes

Simple cooking from Southeast France is distinguished by fresh flavors and seasonal ingredients. Feel free to use any herbs you have on hand for this recipe, including dried ones. This dish is also wonderful served at room temperature for an outdoor buffet or a picnic.

- 1 cup (6 oz/185 g) cherry tomatoes, preferably a mix of colors
- 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
- 4 center-cut wild salmon fillets (about 6 oz/185 g each)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon
- 1 lb (500 g) fingerling potatoes
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

SERVES 4

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
1. In a small bowl, toss together the cherry tomatoes and 1 teaspoon of the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Brush the salmon with 1 teaspoon of the oil and season with the rosemary, tarragon, salt, and pepper. Set aside.
1. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise and cut any large ones in half crosswise as well. (You want them to be about the same size.) In a bowl, toss together the potatoes and the 2 tablespoons oil. Place, cut side down, on the prepared pan and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 8 minutes, then stir the potatoes. Place the tomatoes and salmon on the pan and continue roasting until the potatoes are fork-tender, the tomatoes just begin to burst, and the salmon is opaque throughout, 8–10 minutes longer.
1. Sprinkle the parsley over the vegetables and pour the lemon juice over the salmon. Serve right away.
