## Jamaican Coconut Pie

Makes 1 open-faced 8-inch short-crust pie, filled with sweetened coconut—brown sugar paste

This pie, known as gizada in Jamaica, is often made and sold as individual tarts, but we like to bake ours in a pie plate and top it with a skinny lattice crust. It’s one of the easiest pies we know, and like everything sweet and baked from Jamaica, it’s super yummy. The slices are beautiful, with a sweet rich brown-sugar-and-coconut filling.

DOUGH

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 8 tablespoons (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, coarsely chopped
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1 to 2 tablespoons ice water, or as needed

FILLING

- Scant 1 1/4 cups dried unsweetened shredded coconut or sweetened shredded coconut
- 1/2 cup boiling water (if using dried coconut)
- 1 cup packed light or dark brown sugar
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, shortening, or lard

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place the flour and butter in a food processor and process to the consistency of a fine meal. Add the sugar, salt, and egg yolk, and pulse briefly to combine. Add 1 to 2 table-spoons ice water and pulse. Try to pull the mixture together into a dough; if it’s still dry and crumbly, add a little more water.
1. Transfer the dough to a heavy plastic bag and press it from the outside into a disk. Refrigerate for 1 hour, or until ready to use.
1. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: If using dried coconut, place 1 cup of it in a bowl and pour over the boiling water. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes.
1. In a small bowl, mix together the sugar and cornstarch, then stir into the coconut mixture. Or mix the sugar and cornstarch in a medium bowl and stir in 1 cup of the sweetened shredded coconut.
1. Melt the butter in a small pot over medium-low heat. Add the coconut-sugar mixture and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning or sticking, until the mixture thickens.
1. Transfer to a bowl to cool to room temperature, then, if not using immediately, refrigerate, covered. (You should have about 1 1/2 cups filling.) Thirty minutes before using it, take the filling out of the refrigerator. It hardens once cooled, but it can be stirred and softened with a wooden spoon.
1. Stir the remaining 1/4 cup coconut into the filling and set aside.
1. Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F.
1. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to a round 10 to 11 inches in diameter. Drape it over an 8-inch pie plate and gently ease it into the round. Trim off the edges just wider than the edge of the pie plate; reserve the trimmings.
1. Spread the filling in the pie shell, mounding it in the center and then spreading it outward. Use the trimmed pastry edges to make lattice strips if you wish (see the Note on page 19), and place on top of the filling. (Alternatively, you could dust them with sugar or cinnamon sugar, see Glossary, and bake them as cookies on a baking sheet until they start to turn golden, 7 to 10 minutes, depending on thickness.)
1. Bake the pie until lightly touched with brown, about 35 minutes. Let stand for at least 10 minutes to firm up and serve warm or at room temperature, with a scoop of mango or lemon sorbet for contrast, if you wish.
