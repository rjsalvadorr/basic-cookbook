## Roast Chicken & Potatoes With Drippings

Rotisserie chickens turn on spits in open markets and in front of butcher shops throughout France, often with their juices dripping onto the potatoes cooking below. When you choose your chicken, you are asked if you’d like potatoes as well. If you answer yes, which I always do, potatoes and juices (and sometimes onions and peppers) are ladled into a heatproof bag along with the chicken. At home, to replicate those jus-bathed potatoes, I position the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan, with the potatoes beneath.

SERVES 6

- 1 whole chicken, about 31/2 lb (1.75 kg)
- 2 tsp sea salt
- 2 tsp freshly ground pepper
- 3–4 fresh rosemary sprigs
- 3–4 fresh thyme sprigs
- 2 fresh or 1 dried bay leaf
- 8–10 small Yukon gold potatoes, peeled or unpeeled
- 1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped
- 2 red sweet peppers such as bell, seeded and cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch (12-mm) strips
- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Rub the chicken, inside and out, with the salt, pepper, and the rosemary and thyme sprigs, then place the sprigs and the bay leaves in the cavity. Using kitchen string, tie the drumsticks together.
1. Place the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan just large enough to hold it and roast, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a large saucepan, add water to cover by 1 inch (2.5 cm), and bring to a boil over medium- high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook until the potatoes are just beginning to become tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.
1. Remove the roasting pan from the oven, lift out the chicken and rack, and place the potatoes, onion, and peppers in the pan. Dot the vegetables with 1/2 tablespoon of the butter, replace the chicken and rack, and rub the chicken all over with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter. Continue to roast until the chicken is golden brown and the juice runs clear when a thigh is pierced with a knife tip, or an instant-read thermometer inserted into a thigh registers 165°F (74°C), and the potatoes are tender when pierced with the knife, about 45 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a carving board and let rest for 10 minutes.
1. To serve, carve the chicken and pour any collected carving juices back into the pan. Arrange the chicken on a platter, surround it with the vegetables, and drizzle the pan juices over the chicken.
