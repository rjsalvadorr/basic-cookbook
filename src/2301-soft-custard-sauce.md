## Soft Custard Sauce

- 3 egg yolks
- 4 tablespoons of sugar
- Pinch of salt
- 1 cup of scalded milk
- Flavoring

Heat water in the lower part of a double boiler. Beat the egg yolks lightly and put them in the top section of the boiler with a pinch of salt and the sugar. Gradually add the scalded milk, stirring it in slowly with a wooden spoon. Cook and stir until the mixture begins to form a film or coating on the spoon. Do not let the water boil. If this sauce is overcooked, it will curdle. As soon as the sauce coats the spoon slightly, take it from the hot water and pour into a cool bowl. Flavor with vanilla, sherry or with any favorite liquor or brandy: Grand Marnier, Cognac, rum, Benedictine.
