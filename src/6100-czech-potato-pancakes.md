## Czech Potato Pancakes

Makes about 15 small, golden savory pancakes; allow 2 or 3 per person

These potato pancakes are called bramborak. Like latkes, the Jewish potato cakes, and Irish Potato Breads, they’re made with grated potato. The potato is moistened with milk and egg, then turned into an easily managed batter with a little flour. Traditionally the pancakes are cooked in a good quarter inch of hot oil or lard; we like the crispness that comes from using just a generous covering on a hot, heavy skillet. You can also cook them in bacon grease for a salty diner-style griddle pancake. Serve for lunch, with wilted greens or a salad or a fresh salsa; or for a hearty breakfast, with eggs, fried tomatoes, and toast.

- About 1 pound floury (baking) potatoes, peeled and grated (3 packed cups)
- 1/4 cup milk, heated until hot
- 1 large or extra-large egg
- 1 to 2 teaspoons minced fresh chives, or 1/2 teaspoon dried chives
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Grinding of black pepper, or to taste
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- About 1/4 cup peanut oil, lard, or bacon grease for frying

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place the potatoes in a sieve and press out excess liquid. Transfer them to a bowl and stir in the hot milk. Whisk the egg, then stir it in. Add the chives and seasonings, then stir in flour to make a batter. Set aside.
1. Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil or fat (you want to start with enough oil to thoroughly cover the pan) in a heavy skillet over high heat. Once it is very hot, lower the heat to medium-high.
1. Scoop up about 2 tablespoons batter and place it gently in the hot oil. Use the back of a spoon or cup to help it flatten out to a round just over 2 inches across. Repeat until the skillet is fairly full (3 or 4 more pancakes, depending on the size of your skillet).
1. Cook until golden on the first side, 2 to 3 minutes, then turn over, press down gently with your spatula, and cook until golden, another 2 minutes or so. Move the pancakes around if your skillet is not cooking them evenly. Turn out onto a paper towel—lined plate and blot any excess oil from both sides of the pancakes, then place on a plate in a warm oven while you cook the remaining batter.
1. Be sure to bring the oil up to temperature before cooking the remaining pancakes, and add more oil to the pan if it starts getting dry after two batches.

NOTE We have tried using a food processor to make the equivalent of hand-grated potatoes. Unfortunately, any processor produces small chunks of potato that don’t cook as evenly as the flat potato gratings that are ideal for these pancakes. Actually, once peeled, the potatoes can be quickly grated by hand on the coarse side of a box grater; like many tasks, it’s a job that is less laborious than it sounds.
